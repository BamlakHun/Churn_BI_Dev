Stakeholders request 

we are having an issue with keeping employees so we would lile a data anlalyst to help to proactively find employees that are risk. 


Approach 

Initiate a pilot programme with new employees.
Build an auto ML model on previous data that can predict a new employees will leave.

Project Questions 
What does success look like 
what does failure look like
What trends are important 
What actions affect the trend 


Machine learning work flow
Train: Train ML model with 80% the pilot employee data. 
Test: Test the ML model for accuracy on the remaining 20% the pilot employee data.
Predict: use the Optimized model to predict which employees in the pilot employee data will churn.

Stakeholder Request:
The company is facing challenges with employee retention and has requested the assistance of a data analyst to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving. The goal is to predict and reduce turnover by analyzing employee data.


Approach:
1. Pilot Program:
Initiate a pilot program targeting new employees to monitor retention patterns and gather relevant data for analysis.

2. AutoML Model:
Develop an AutoML model using historical data to predict the likelihood of new employees leaving the company. This will leverage machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights.


Deliverables:
Report:
A comprehensive report detailing the findings, insights, and predictions regarding employee retention, along with recommendations for action.


Analysis Questions:
1. What factors are causing employees to leave?
Identifying key drivers behind employee turnover is crucial for targeted interventions.

2. Who is predicted to leave?
Using the AutoML model to predict which employees are at risk of leaving in the near future.

3. Are employees satisfied?
Understanding employee satisfaction levels and their correlation with retention.

4. Which departments have the most churn?
Identifying areas within the organization with high employee turnover to focus retention efforts.

Project Questions:
1. What does success look like?
Success is defined by the ability to predict employee departures with a high degree of accuracy, resulting in improved retention strategies.

2. What does failure look like?
Failure would be characterized by an inability to accurately predict turnover or implement effective strategies to reduce it.

3. What trends are most important?
Identifying key trends, such as tenure, performance metrics, satisfaction scores, or department-specific factors, that have the most impact on retention.

4. What actions affect these trends?
Understanding the actions, policies, or interventions that can influence employee satisfaction and retention, such as leadership changes, compensation adjustments, or work-life balance initiatives.
