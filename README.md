# Churn_BI_Dev

Summary: 
This project aims to leverage machine learning to address employee retention by predicting which new hires are at risk of leaving. By utilizing AutoML and data analysis, the model will provide actionable insights that can guide the company’s retention efforts.
<br/><br/> 
# Approach

Pilot Program Selection:<br/>
- Focus on a group of newly hired employees to test the predictive model.<br/>

Model Development:
- Build an AutoML model that uses historical employee data to predict whether a new hire is
- likely to leave the company.<br/>

Predictive Insights:<br/>
- Use the model’s predictions to inform retention strategies.<br/>

# ML Workflow<br/>
- Train: Train the AutoML model on historical employee data.<br/>
- Test: Evaluate the model’s performance and accuracy.<br/>
- Predict: Generate predictions on new employee data to identify potential attrition risks.<br/>

# Tools Used
- BigQuery: For data storage and processing.<br/>
- Google Colab: For model development and experimentation.<br/>
- Looker Studio: For building interactive dashboards and data visualizations.<br/><br/>
# Deliverables
Report/Dashboard:<br/>
- Factors contributing to employee attrition.<br/>
- Predictions for which employees are at risk of leaving.<br/>
- Employee satisfaction levels.<br/>
- Identification of departments with the highest churn rates.<br/>
